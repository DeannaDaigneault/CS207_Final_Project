# CS207_Final_Project
This will be where I put information about my final project.

# Introduction
This is supposed to be a rice dispenser powered by a motor which is controlled by a few buttons and an Arduino Uno, and there are 4 LEDs to indicate which mode you are on. The motor is connected to a turbine, like in a cereal dispenser in a hotel breakfast.

# Summary
One of the buttons (the one on the right in this case) sets the mode/portion amount, and the other (on the left) will trigger the motor to spin based on the mode that is set. So mode 2/portion amount for 2 people would dispense enough for 2 people. It is pretty simple, especially when you have the things needed.
