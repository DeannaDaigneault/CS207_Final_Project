# CS207_Final_Project
This will be where I put information about my final project.

# Introduction
This is supposed to be a rice dispenser powered by a motor which is controlled by a few buttons and an Arduino Uno, and there are 4 LEDs to indicate which mode you are on. The motor is connected to a turbine, like in a cereal dispenser in a hotel breakfast.

# Summary
One of the buttons (the one on the right in this case) sets the mode/portion amount, and the other (on the left) will trigger the motor to spin based on the mode that is set. So mode 2/portion amount for 2 people would dispense enough for 2 people. It is pretty simple, especially when you have the things needed.

# Hardware
What you will need:
1 Arduino Uno
2 Pushbuttons (pulldown)
4 LEDs (add more if you want more)
1 Breadboard (standard size or longer)
1 Diode
1 Transistor (3 pin like in a kit)
6 Resistors of 570Ω ±5% tolerance (green, purple, and red lines with one gold line)
1 Resistor of 220Ω ±5% tolerance (all red lines with one gold line)
1 5 volt motor
A bunch of wires
