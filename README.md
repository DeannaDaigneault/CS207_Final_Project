# CS207_Final_Project
This will be where I put information about my final project.

# Introduction
This is supposed to be a rice dispenser powered by a motor which is controlled by a few buttons and an Arduino Uno, and there are 4 LEDs to indicate which mode you are on. The motor is connected to a turbine, like in a cereal dispenser in a hotel breakfast.

# Summary
One of the buttons (the one on the right in this case) sets the mode/portion amount, and the other (on the left) will trigger the motor to spin based on the mode that is set. So mode 2/portion amount for 2 people would dispense enough for 2 people. It is pretty simple, especially when you have the things needed.

# Hardware
What you will need:
* 1 Arduino Uno
* 2 Pushbuttons (pulldown)
* 4 LEDs (add more if you want more)
* 1 Breadboard (standard size or longer)
* 1 Diode
* 1 Transistor (3 pin like in a kit)
* 6 Resistors of 570Ω ±5% tolerance (green, purple, and red lines with one gold line)
* 1 Resistor of 220Ω ±5% tolerance (all red lines with one gold line)
* 1 5 volt motor
* 1 Medium size pet food dispenser
* 1 3D printed turbine
* A drill with a saw attachment
* A bunch of wires

# Instructions
* Step 1:
Hook up the LEDs onto the breadboard. Place the resistors first before the wires (and it is recommended before the LEDs too).
Put the pushbuttons on the breadboard and hook them up too.


* Step 2:
Measure the size of your motor and mark the side of your pet food dispenser based off the measurement.
Afterwards, get the drill and attach the drill, make sure the saw size matches the motor. Go ahead and drill the hole in the side of the food dispenser.

* Step 3: 
Hook up the transistor and motor. Now is a good time to upload the code into the Arduino.

* Step 4:
Place the turbine into the food dispenser and then the motor into the hole you drilled out earlier. Tape the end of the motor to make sure it stays.
